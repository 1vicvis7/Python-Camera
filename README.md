# Python-Camera

Hi friends!!,

This is my first project using Python Tkinter.
A simple Camera mimic using python, where camera capabilities were used using Open-cv (cv2 module) and GUI using Tkinter.
The important thing to note is, to create a executable file, we need to use the Pyinstaller library and follow the steps

  -> To install, in Command Prompt/terminal "pip install pyinstaller"
  -> To create executable file, open Command Prompt/terminal in the respective directory where the python script is present (preferably create a new folder)
  and type in this command 
        => pyinstaller --onefile {file name}.py
  -> this will generate the executable file ({file name}.exe) in dist folder which will be created by the command itself.
  
  Hope this project finds you some help!!!!
  
  Thank you!!
